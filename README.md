#Yaichao-UI: react UI demos
This repository provides react components written in JSX with the use of a wide variety of external ready-made components, demonstrating how they can integrate with other components.

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Parts required:
- The components built here rely on the [MUI material-UI library for react.](https://mui.com/). -> `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`
- The Carrousel component is mostly just a wrapper around [Flicking](https://naver.github.io/egjs-flicking/) -> `npm install @egjs/react-flicking`
